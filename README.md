# [badersur.github.io][bs-pages] v5

[![Travis Status][travis-status-img]][travis-status]
[![Netlify Status][netlify-status-img]][netlify-status]

This is the source code for [my github pages][bs-pages]. It's a Progressive Web
Application (PWA) showing my skills, completed courses, projects and blog posts
using [React][react] and [Gatsby][gatsby].

## Links

-   [badersur.github.io][bs-pages] (built by [Travis CI][travis-ci])

-   [badersur.netlify.com][bs-netlify] (built by [Netlify][netlify]'s
    continuous deployment)

## Features

-   Responsive design using vanilla CSS (Flexbox and Grid).

-   Performance optimization - Images, JavaScript, HTML and CSS are minifed.

-   Using modern JavaScript/TypeScript features.

-   Offline support thanks to [Service Worker][sw] and `gatsby-plugin-offline`.

-   Static asset revisioning by appending content hash to filenames for
    better caching.

## Prerequisites

-   [Node.js][node] and ([npm][npm] or [yarn][yarn]).

    I suggest using [nvm][nvm] to download Node.js and manage multiple versions
    of it. `npm` is bundled with Node.js but you may want to update it using the
    command: `npm i npm@latest -g`

-   Or just use [Docker][docker]!

## Usage

1. Open the Terminal / Command Prompt (cmd).

2. Clone the repo. using [git][git] (or [download it][download]).

    `git clone https://github.com/badersur/badersur.github.io`

3. Change your current directory to repo.'s directory.

    `cd badersur.github.io`

4. Either use Docker or node package managers (npm / yarn):

    - Using Docker, and **if you have node installed**, then just run:

        - `npm run develop:docker` and visit http://localhost:8000/ to run the
          development version of the site.
        - `npm run serve:docker` and visit http://localhost:9000/ to run the
          production version.

        **In case you don't have node installed**, run:

        - for the development version:

            1. `docker-compose build` to _build_ it.
            2. `docker-compose up` to run it.

        - for the production version:

            1. `docker build -t bs-app .` to _build_ it.
            2. `docker run --rm --detach --publish 9000:9000 bs-app`

        Note: you may need to add `sudo` before the `docker` commands!

    - Using package managers:

        1. Install the dependencies using npm or yarn.

            - `npm i`
            - `yarn`

        2. Either use npm scripts or [Netlify CLI][netlify-cli]:

            - using npm scripts, run:

                - `npm run develop` and visit the development version of the app
                  at: http://localhost:8000/en/
                - `npm run build` to have a production-ready version of the app.
                - `npm run serve` and open the production version
                  at: http://localhost:9000/en/

            - using [Netlify CLI][netlify-cli], run:

                1. `npm install netlify-cli -g`
                2. `netlify dev` to serve the production version of the app
                   and visit the link shown in the screen...
